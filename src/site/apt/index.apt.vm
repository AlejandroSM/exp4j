Introduction

  exp4j is capable of evaluating expressions and functions in the real domain. It's a small (40KB) library without any external dependencies, that implements {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm}Dijkstra's Shunting Yard Algorithm}}.
  exp4j comes with a standard set of built-in functions and operators. Additionally users are able to create custom operators and functions.

* Version 0.4.0 API Changes

	As of Version 0.4.0 exp4j has been completely rewritten and a lot of API changes have been introduced. Please don't hate me ;). {{{http://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/v0.3.11}The old version is still available}}. Im currently planning to supply a legacy-pack with wrappers for the old API, but I'm not sure that it is feasible.
	The rewrite was IMHO necessary to accommodate various features (e.g. implicit multiplication) and first of all: Improved performance.

* Version 0.3.11

    The former version of exp4j is available {{{http://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/v0.3.11}here}}

* Examples

    The examples are mostly taken from the test class {{{https://github.com/fasseg/exp4j/blob/master/src/test/java/net/objecthunter/exp4j/ExpressionBuilderTest.java}ExpressionBuilderTest}} and use {{{https://github.com/junit-team/junit/wiki/Assertions}JUnit's assertXXX()}} methods to check for correct results.

* Apache Maven

    In order to include exp4j as a dependency using Apache Maven you can the following dependency decalration can be used

+--
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.objecthunter</groupId>
    <artifactId>exp4j</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
+--

* Usage


** Evaluating an expression

    In order to evaluate an expression. The <<<ExpressionBuilder>>> class can be used to create an <<<Expression>>> object which is capable of evaluation. Custom functions and custom operators can be set via calls to <<<ExpressionBuilder.function()>>> and <<<ExpressionBuilder.operator()>>>. Any given variables can be set on the <<<Expression>>> object returned by <<<ExpressionBuilder.build()>>> via calls to <<<Expression.variable()>>>

*** Example 1:

    Evaluate a simple expression

+--
Expression e = new ExpressionBuilder("3 * sin(y) - 2 / (x - 2)")
        .variables("x", "y")
        .build()
        .setVariable("x", 2.3)
        .setVariable("y", 3.14);
double result = e.evaluate();
+--

** Variable declaration

	Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore <<<_>>> and can only include letters, digits or underscores.
	
	the following are valid variable names:

	 * <<<varX>>>

	 * <<<_x1>>>

	 * <<<_var_X_1>>>

	 while <<<1_var_x>>> is not as it does not start with a letter or a underscore.

** Implicit multiplication

	 Since v0.4.0 exp4j does support implicit multiplication. Therefore an expression like <<<2cos(yx)>>> will be interpreted as <<<2*cos(y*x)>>>

*** Example 3

	 Using implicit muliplication

+---
double result = new ExpressionBuilder("2cos(xy)")
        .variables("x","y")
        .build()
        .setVariable("x", 0.5d)
        .setVariable("y", 0.25d)
        .evaluate();
assertEquals(2d * Math.cos(0.5d * 0.25d), result, 0d);
+---


** Scientific notation

	Since version 0.3.5 it is possible to use scientific notation for numbers {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation}see wikipedia}}.
	The number is split into a significand/mantissa <<<y>>> and exponent <<<x>>> of the form <<<yEx>>> which is evaluated as <<<y * 10^x>>>.
	Be aware that 'e/E' is no operator but part of a number and therefore an expression like <<<1.1e-(x*2)>>> can not be evaluated.
	An example using the Fine-structure constant <<<α=7.2973525698  * 10^−3>>>:

*** Example 2

    Use scientific notation in an expression

+--
String expr = "7.2973525698e-3";
double expected = Double.parseDouble(expr);
Expression e = new ExpressionBuilder(expr).build();
assertEquals(expected, e.evaluate(),0d);
+--

** Custom functions

  	you can extend the abstract class Function in order to use custom functions in expressions. you only have to implement the
  	<<<apply(double... args)>>> method. In the following example a function for the logarithm to the base 2 is created and used in a following expression.

*** Example 3

    A custom function calculating the logarithm to an arbitrary base using the identity <log(value, base) = ln(value)/ln(base)>

+--
Function logb = new Function("logb", 2) {
    @Override
    public double apply(double... args) {
        return Math.log(args[0]) / Math.log(args[1]);
    }
};
double result = new ExpressionBuilder("logb(8, 2)")
        .function(logb)
        .build()
        .evaluate();
double expected = 3;
assertEquals(expected, result, 0d);
+--

	you can also define multi argument functions like <<<avg(a,b,c,d)>>> via the constructor <<<Function(String name, int argc)>>>, with <<<argc>>> being the argument count.
	The following example uses a custom function which returns the average of four values.

*** Example 4

    A custom average function taking 4 arguments:

+--
Function avg = new Function("avg", 4) {

    @Override
    public double apply(double... args) {
        double sum = 0;
        for (double arg : args) {
            sum += arg;
        }
        return sum / args.length;
    }
};
double result = new ExpressionBuilder("avg(1,2,3,4)")
        .function(avg)
        .build()
        .evaluate();

double expected = 2.5d;
assertEquals(expected, result, 0d);
+--

** Custom operators

	you can extend the abstract class <<<Operator>>> in order to declare custom operators for use in expressions, with the symbol being one of
	<<<!,#,§,$,&,;,:,~,\<,\>,|,=.>>>. Be aware that adding a Operator with a used symbol overwrites any existing operators including the builtin ones. So it's possible to overwrite e.g. the <<<+>>> operator.
	The constructor of an Operator takes up to 4 arguments:
	
 * the symbol used for this operation (one of <<<!,#,§,$,&,;,:,~,\<,\>,|,=>>>)
 
 * if the operation is left associative
 
 * the precedence of the operation
 
 * the number of operands the operator has (<<<1 or 2>>>)


*** Example 5

    Create a custom operator for calculating the factorial

+--
Operator factorial = new Operator("!", 1, true, Operator.PRECEDENCE_POWER + 1) {

    @Override
    public double apply(double... args) {
        final int arg = (int) args[0];
        if ((double) arg != args[0]) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Operand for factorial has to be an integer");
        }
        if (arg < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The operand of the factorial can not be less than zero");
        }
        double result = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= arg; i++) {
            result *= i;
        }
        return result;
    }
};

double result = new ExpressionBuilder("3!")
        .operator(factorial)
        .build()
        .evaluate();

double expected = 6d;
assertEquals(expected, result, 0d);

+--

** Built-in operators
	 
	 
 * Addition: <<<2 + 2>>>
 
 * Subtraction: <<<2 - 2>>>
 
 * Multiplication: <<<2 * 2>>>
 
 * Division:  <<<2 / 2>>>
 
 * Exponentation: <<<2 ^ 2>>>
 
 * Unary Minus,Plus (Sign Operators): <<<+2 - (-2)>>>
 
 * Modulo: <<<2 % 2>>>
 

** Precedence of unary minus and power operators

	The precedence of the unary minus operator is lower than the precedence of the power operator. This means that an expression like <<<-1^2>>> is evaluated as <<<-(1^2)>>> not as <<<(-1)^2>>>.


** Division by zero in operations and functions
	
	exp4j throws a ArithmeticException when a division by zero is attempted. When implementing Operator or Function involving divisions the implementor has to make sure that a corresponding RuntimeException is thrown.
	
*** Example 6

    Throw an Arithmetic exception when a division by zero is attempted

+--
Operator reciprocal = new Operator("$", 1, true, Operator.PRECEDENCE_DIVISION) {
    @Override
    public double apply(final double... args) {
        if (args[0] == 0d) {
            throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero!");
        }
        return 1d / args[0];
    }
};
Expression e = new ExpressionBuilder("0$").operator(reciprocal).build();
e.evaluate(); // <- this call will throw an ArithmeticException
+--

	 
** Built-in functions
	 
	 
 * <<<abs>>>: absolute value
 
 * <<<acos>>>: arc cosine
 
 * <<<asin>>>: arc sine
 
 * <<<atan>>>: arc tangent
 
 * <<<cbrt>>>: cubic root
 
 * <<<ceil>>>: nearest upper integer
 
 * <<<cos>>>: cosine
 
 * <<<cosh>>>: hyperbolic cosine
 
 * <<<exp>>>: euler's number raised to the power (e^x)
 
 * <<<floor>>>: nearest lower integer
 
 * <<<log>>>: logarithmus naturalis (base e)
 
 * <<<log10>>>: logarithm (base 10)

 * <<<log2>>>: logarithm (base 2)

 * <<<sin>>>: sine
 
 * <<<sinh>>>: hyperbolic sine
 
 * <<<sqrt>>>: square root
 
 * <<<tan>>>: tangent
 
 * <<<tanh>>>: hyperbolic tangent


** Validation of expression

    Since version 0.4.0 exp4j has an added feature to validate expressions. Users can call <<<Expression.validate()>>> for some generic checks on the expression. E.g. A check if all variables have been set.

*** Example 7

    Validate an expression

+--
Expression e = new ExpressionBuilder("x")
        .build();

ValidationResult res = e.validate();
assertFalse(res.isValid());
assertEquals(1, res.getErrors().size());

e.variable("x",1d);
res = e.validate();
assertTrue(res.isValid());
+--

** Error handling

    The former versions of exp4j came with a set of Exceptions which had to be caught by the user, since this was often an unnecessary hassle, exp4j as of Version 0.4.0 only throws <<<RuntimeExceptions>>> and foremost <<<IllegalArgumentExceptions>>> from the standard Java API.
